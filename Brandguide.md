## Visual Identity

### CFA Program and Capability Colors

For CFA Program, the Dark Blue gradient is used against Dark Blue most of the time (with the occasional use of Warm White or White backgrounds when needed).

For Certify, Learn, Network, and Insights applications, corresponding color gradients are used against Warm White or White backgrounds.

Please reference this page for the breakdown of color values. All of our gradients are created using capability colors, 100% opacity at one end to 20% opacity at the other as outlined here.

## Color Usage

Our color palette is a big part of the way we distinguish between the parent brand and capabilities. The palette shown represents the overall proportional use of color based on our brand architecture.

- For all parent brand communications, Bright Blue is used against a Dark Blue background. Warm White and white backgrounds can also be used on occasion.
- For CFA Program applications, use the Blue Gradient against a Dark Blue background.
- For capability-specific applications, use corresponding gradients. Backgrounds should typically be warm white or white. On occasion, capability colors can be used as background colors.

**Note:**  
When needed, the graphic device of our capabilities can also reverse to a white gradient on a photograph with enough contrast or a solid color background of that capability.

Please use the correct color combinations outlined in this section to align to our brand architecture and enhance distinction between our parent brand and capabilities.

## Typography: Hierarchy

Consistent use of our typographic style strengthens our message and creates familiarity with our brand. The main objective of our typographic style and hierarchy is to support the clear communication of our key messages.

The examples here show how to use Flecha S Medium and Azo sans with maximum impact while reinforcing our brand voice and personality. Flecha S Medium, set in sentence case is used for all featured headlines and words. On any one page, only one featured headline or word is emphasized at a time. When emphasized, the featured headline or word should stand out, large on the page compared to other typography. All other communication on the same page is smaller in comparison.

**Important:**  
All typography is either black or reversed white. Never color typography in any part of our system.

#### Cover/Page header:
Azo Sans Bold, or Regular  
Upper case  
Leading: Type size pt x 1.35  
Tracking: 100pt

#### Display headline:
Flecha S Medium  
Sentence case  
Leading: Type size pt x 1  
Tracking: Opt

#### Section headers:
Flecha S Medium  
Sentence case  
Leading: Type size pt x 1  
Tracking: Opt

#### Body header and copy:
Azo Sans Bold, Medium, Medium Italic, Regular, and Italic  
Sentence case  
Leading: Type size pt x 1.35  
Tracking: Opt

##### Example Body Copy:
**Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet**  
Nihil scripta in eam, nibh iisque eos ei, cu nonumes appetere. At mazim iudico labore vim, dicam scaevola eloquentiam eum ne. Elit sententiae et sit. Est adin habemus oporteat facilisis, nam at quando laudem. Cu nibh tation vel, sed error appetere. Vel eius affert. No suas albucius adipisci pro. His ex nusquam democritum.

## Typography

Flecha S Medium is our headline typeface, large and well represented as the first typeface you see in our communications. It's a modern, unique, and streamlined serif. The square terminals and simplified strokes work well with the squares from our graphic device.

We also use Azo sans and all the weights as our body copy to support Flecha S Medium in paragraphs and detailed information. Azo sans is a robust typeface that is a bit more neutral and appropriate for long form content.

**Alternative typefaces**  
Georgia Regular is the acceptable substitute for our headline typeface when Flecha S Medium is not available. Arial can be used as an alternative to our body copy typeface Azo.

Georgia Regular and Arial are universally available on all platforms.

#### Headline typeface
Georgia Regular

#### Body copy typeface
Arial Bold  
*Arial Bold Italic*

#### Numerals
