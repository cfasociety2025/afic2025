# Latest Updates - Media Page & Navbar Fixes

## Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Fixed About Dropdown Hover Issue
**Problem:** Dropdown menu was closing when trying to hover over it to select an option.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the gap (`mt-2`) that was causing the hover to break
- Restructured the dropdown to have continuous hover area from button to menu
- Added `pt-2` padding inside the dropdown container instead of margin
- Now the dropdown stays open smoothly as you move from button to menu options

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified the dropdown structure in `app/components/Navbar.js`
- Changed from `mt-2` on dropdown div to `pt-2` on wrapper div
- Added `group` class for better hover control

### ✅ 2. Removed Newsletter Subscription Section
**Problem:** Client requested removal of the "Subscribe to Our Newsletter" section at the top of the media page.

**Solution:**
- Completely removed the newsletter subscription form section
- Removed unused React state variables (`email`, `subscribed`)
- Removed `handleSubscribe` function
- Cleaned up unused `useState` import

**Files Modified:**
- `app/components/MediaContent.js`
