## Developer Notes

- All components use 'use client' directive where needed for interactivity
- Newsletter subscription currently shows success message but doesn't persist data
- Dropdown state management uses React hooks (useState)
- Mobile dropdown closes automatically on navigation
- All external links use target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer" for security
- Form includes basic validation (required email field)
